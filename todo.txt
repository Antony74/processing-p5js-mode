X add 'dist' target to build.xml
X add 'clean' target to build.xml
X how do we edit html, text, css? 
X set an auto-update block in the html to include the js files
X   insert files into html method:
X     first add anything from /libraries
X     then anything from the main directory
X     then the main sketch.js file
X don't include dom.js and sound.js by default
X html not reloading in editor after rebuild
X need to write template correctly on first load
o   need to call updateHtml() on init
X   can't do that b/c the Sketch and Editor objects don't exist yet
X use temp files to run without saving
X   how to clear these out when rewriting the html
X   need to use some sort of weird temp name format
X   contradiction between wanting valid files locally, always
o   should it be writing some .tmp.html files instead?
o     writeHtml() could be called to save those out in the interim
X     force save of HTML file when updating
X implement handling for favicon.ico
X   should be able to send the image from PApplet
X import all the examples
X   also generate the ordering for the category folders
X   get assets to work properly

_ hide 'libraries' folder from Java Mode
_ hide contrib examples and contrib libraries from Java Mode

_ import library
_   allow some sort of single .js file library setup?
_   it's actually 'add library' not 'import' in this case
_   though this would also require a way to *remove* the libraries too
_   get p5.dom.js and p5.sound.js into the menu
_   get contributed libraries working?

. . .

_ option update p5*.js in the libraries subfolder
_   automatically notify user if version in the template is updated?

_ how do we bring back the auto-update block if it's broken?
_   or if it's not present, stop updating that file?

_ make it possible for the main class to be something besides the default name
_   want to use sketch.js (this is a fine restriction)
_   how difficult to have modes determine whether a sketch is a sketch?
_     so that the main sketch class doesn't have to follow a naming convention
_   Mode.rebuildSketchbookTree() handles creation of the sketchbook menu
_   which calls Base.addSketches() to do the actual adding
_   would need some means of specifying what the 'main' file is
_     at least with p5js we could provisionally just use sketch.js?

_ mode option for showing html and css or not
_   is it time to add Mode preferences?
_ other supported types from p5js editor
_   txt, html, css, js, json, scss, xml, csv, less
_   include: html, css, js, json, scss, less
_   exclude: xml, txt, csv (like to be in data folder)
_ add basic syntax highlighting for css
