X add 'dist' target to build.xml
X add 'clean' target to build.xml
X how do we edit html, text, css? 
X set an auto-update block in the html to include the js files
X   insert files into html method:
X     first add anything from /libraries
X     then anything from the main directory
X     then the main sketch.js file
X don't include dom.js and sound.js by default


_ html not reloading in editor after rebuild
_ use temp files to run without saving
_   how to clear these out when rewriting the html
_   need to use some sort of weird temp name format
_   contradiction between wanting valid files locally, always
_   should it be writing some .tmp.html files instead?
_     writeHtml() could be called to save those out in the interim

_ import all the examples

_ import library
_   allow some sort of single .js file library setup? 
_   though this would also require a way to *remove* the libraries too
_   get p5.dom.js and p5.sound.js into the menu
_   get contributed libraries working?

_ make it possible for the main class to be something besides the default name
_   want to use sketch.js (this is a fine restriction)
_   how difficult to have modes determine whether a sketch is a sketch?
_     so that the main sketch class doesn't have to follow a naming convention
_   Mode.rebuildSketchbookTree() handles creation of the sketchbook menu
_   which calls Base.addSketches() to do the actual adding
_   would need some means of specifying what the 'main' file is
_     at least with p5js we could provisionally just use sketch.js?

_ how do we bring back the auto-update block if it's broken?
_   or if it's not present, stop updating that file?
_ update p5*.js in the libraries subfolder

_ mode option for showing html and css or not
_   is it time to add Mode preferences?
_ other supported types from p5js editor
_   txt, html, css, js, json, scss, xml, csv, less
_   include: html, css, js, json, scss, less
_   exclude: xml, txt, csv (like to be in data folder)
_ add basic syntax highlighting for css
